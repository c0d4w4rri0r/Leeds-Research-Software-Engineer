\f0\fs22 \cf2 \cb3 \CocoaLigature0 Problem 1. I would show the researcher the following command line.\

\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\CocoaLigature1 \

\fs22 \cf6 \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \CocoaLigature0 ls datafile*.csv | cat | sed 'p;s/\\.csv/\\.dat/' | xargs -n2 mv\cf2 \
\
and explain it as follows.\
\
when in the appropriate directory \cf6 ls datafile*.csv\cf2  finds all files beginning with \'91datafile\'92 and ending in \'91.csv\'92. The \'91\cf6 |\cf2 \'92 symbol indicated the output of the command is being passed as input to a new command. The \cf6 cat\cf2  command ensures the text is formatted so each filename is on its own line. This is passed to the \cf6 sed\cf2  command. \cf6 Sed\cf2  is a program a bit like a text editor find and replace function. The commands given to \cf6 sed\cf2  can be broken down as follows \'91\cf6 p\cf2 \'92 prints the line unmodified, \'91\cf6 ;\cf2 \'92 separates commands. \'92\cf6 s/\\.csv/\\.dat/\cf2 \'91 prints the line again but with \'91.csv\'92 replaced with \'91.dat\'92. The \'92\cf6 s\cf2 \'92 indicates a find and replace, \'91\cf6 /\cf2 \'91 separates arguments in the command. the first 2 arguments are \'91\cf6 \\.csv\cf2 \'92 (what we want to find) and \'91\cf6 \\.dat\cf2 \'92 the \'91\cf6 \\\cf2 \'92 is necessary to force sed to treat the \'91\cf6 .\cf2 \'92 as an ordinary character. The text should now be formatted with the odd lines as the names of files and the subsequent even lines the names we want them renamed to. This is passed to \cf6 xargs\cf2 . \cf6 xargs\cf2  is a command that can call other commands multiple times. Here \'91\cf6 xargs\cf2 \'92 calls \'91\cf6 mv\cf2 \'92 the command to rename (or move) files. The modifier \'91\cf6 -n2\cf2 \'92 indicates that the text input should be used as arguments for \'91\cf6 mv\cf2 \'92 2 lines at a time so \'91mv\'92 should get called multiple times like this \'91\cf6 mv file_name_on_odd_line file_name_on_even_line\cf2 \'92 renaming all the files.\
\
Problem 2\
\
The command \'91\cf6 wc -w *\cf2 \'92 will count the number of \'91words\'92 (actually numbers in this case) in every file in the current directory. In this case the files are just numbers separated by white space so the word count should equal the number of data points.\
\
Problem 3\
\
First it\'92s clear that the user is using python 2 because the code would not run under python 3. Some modest speed up might be gained by using python 3. (they would have to replace \cf6 range(3,n+1,2)\cf2  with \cf6 list(range(3,n+1,2))\cf2  and \cf6 j=(m*m-3)/2\cf2  with \cf6 j=(m*m-3)//2\cf2 ). Python 2 is depreciate and should not be used except if absolutely necessary for legacy code.\
\
Secondly I\'92d suggest that they might prefer to use the \cf6 primerange\cf2  function in \cf6 sympy.ntheory\cf2  which already implements this functionality and probably does so using a more optimised algorithm. That generally using functions in well established libraries / packages yields better performance than reinventing the wheel.\
\
Lastly I would suggest if they are wedded to using this specific algorithm (perhaps for demonstration purposes) but want to make the code as performant as possible they should consider rewriting it in c.\
\
More generally a number of packages exist to help asses which aspects of a program utilise the most program time. For python I recommend cProfile. An example of applying cProfile is appended.\
\
\cf6 import cProfile, pstats\
\
profiler = cProfile.Profile()\
profiler.enable()\
\
def primes(n):\
    if n==2:\
        return [2]\
    elif n<2:\
        return []\
\
    s=list(range(3,n+1,2))\
    mroot = n ** 0.5\
    half=(n+1)//2-1\
    i=0\
    m=3\
\
    while m <= mroot:\
        if s[i]:\
            j=(m*m-3)//2\
            s[j]=0\
            while j<half:\
                s[j]=0\
                j+=m\
        i=i+1\
        m=2*i+3\
    return [2]+[x for x in s if x]\
\
print(primes(100000)[-1])\
profiler.disable()\
stats = pstats.Stats(profiler).sort_stats('ncalls')\
stats.print_stats()\cf2 \
\
this will indicate that concatenation in the function return staitment is taking a disproportionate amount of time.\
\
Problem 4\
\
I would suggest a face to face meeting at which we would produce a formal document in collaboration with the researcher. Because the project involves collecting personal data with out consent I would also suggest some one from the university legal team and data protection team be given prior notice if they want to attend / offer input.\
\
Important questions to address would be\

Problem 5\

There was supposed to be a Problem 6. The note in the interview preparation specifically said this. Was that a typo because I can\'92t find it.}
